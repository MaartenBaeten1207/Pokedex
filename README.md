# Pokedex
 
Vite is used to deploy the web app.
ReactJS with javascript is used to create the web app.
NodeJS (npm) is used as a package manager.
The implementation is generally made as a web application (based on the i-pad figma design).


Following nice to have features are implemented:
 Besides their favourites, trainers would also like to manage their team of Pokémon. A trainer’s team is limited to 6 Pokémon.
 Trainers would like to see more than one picture for Pokémon if available on the detail screen (think carousel like UI).
 Trainers are used to seeing the stats of a Pokémon in the typical hexagon graph.
 
Would like to implement:
 Pop-up when team is full
 Hamburger menu for mobile version
